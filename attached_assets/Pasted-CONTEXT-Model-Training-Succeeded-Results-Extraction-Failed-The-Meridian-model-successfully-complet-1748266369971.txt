CONTEXT: Model Training Succeeded! Results Extraction Failed
The Meridian model successfully completed MCMC sampling! We just need to fix the results extraction. The Analyzer class doesn't have a get_posterior_metrics() method.
THE ISSUE
In train_meridian_corrected.py, around line 80-90, we're calling:
pythonmetrics = analyzer.get_posterior_metrics()
But this method doesn't exist.
IMMEDIATE FIX
We need to discover what methods the Analyzer actually has. In the extract_meridian_results function, add some debugging to find the correct methods:
pythondef extract_meridian_results(analyzer: 'Analyzer', config: Dict[str, Any], channels: list) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract results from trained Meridian model using correct API"""
    
    try:
        # Debug: List available methods on analyzer
        print(json.dumps({"debug": "Analyzer methods", "methods": [m for m in dir(analyzer) if not m.startswith('_')]}))
        
        # Try different possible method names
        if hasattr(analyzer, 'get_metrics'):
            metrics = analyzer.get_metrics()
        elif hasattr(analyzer, 'compute_metrics'):
            metrics = analyzer.compute_metrics()
        elif hasattr(analyzer, 'extract_metrics'):
            metrics = analyzer.extract_metrics()
        else:
            # Fall back to creating basic results structure
            metrics = {}
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
Based on Meridian's typical API, try these common patterns:
python# Option 1: Direct attribute access
if hasattr(analyzer, 'posterior_metrics'):
    metrics = analyzer.posterior_metrics

# Option 2: Get specific metrics
if hasattr(analyzer, 'get_roi'):
    roi_results = analyzer.get_roi()
if hasattr(analyzer, 'get_media_contribution'):
    contributions = analyzer.get_media_contribution()

# Option 3: The analyzer might be the model itself
if hasattr(model, 'get_posterior_metrics'):
    metrics = model.get_posterior_metrics()
WHAT TO DO

Add the debugging code to see what methods exist on Analyzer
Try the common method patterns above
If all else fails, create a minimal results structure so we can see the model completed

WHAT NOT TO DO

DO NOT re-run the entire training - the model trained successfully!
DO NOT give up - we're so close to getting real MMM results
DO NOT fall back to mock data - we have a real trained model

EXPECTED OUTCOME
Once we find the correct method name, we'll get:

Real ROI calculations from the Bayesian model
Actual channel contributions
Genuine marketing insights from Meridian

This is the final hurdle before having a working MMM platform!
