TASK: Fix spend extraction in train_meridian_corrected.py
FIND this section in the spend calculation part:

    # Try using analyzer's historical spend data first
    hist_spend = analyzer.get_aggregated_spend(new_data=None)
    if hist_spend is not None:

                total_media_spend += channel_spend

    # Method 2: Try accessing the xarray data directly

except Exception as e:

        total_media_spend += 100000.0
The issue is that we're not correctly accessing the xarray data structure that Meridian uses. The media_spend data is stored as an xarray DataArray with dimensions (geo, time, media_channel).
After making this fix, train Model 70 to see:

Correct spend percentages extracted from your actual data
ROI-based optimization working with those real spend values

The debug logs will help us see which extraction method works for your Meridian version.
