Response to You
Yes! The system has successfully moved to using train_meridian_corrected.py with the proper API calls. Looking at your console log:
1:15:05 PM [python-runner] Running Python script: /home/runner/workspace/python_scripts/train_meridian_corrected.py
The script is running and progressing through the proper steps:

✅ Loading data (progress: 10)
✅ Config loaded
✅ Meridian imported (progress: 25)
✅ Preparing data (progress: 30)

However, it's now hitting a date parsing error - which is actually GOOD NEWS! This means:

We're past the model.fit() issue
The correct Meridian API is being used
We're now dealing with real data processing

The error is:
time data "15/01/2022" doesn't match format "%m/%d/%Y"
Your CSV has European dates (DD/MM/YYYY) but the script expects American format. The error message even suggests the fix: use dayfirst=True.

CONTEXT: Date Format Error in Meridian Training
The corrected Meridian training script is now running (good!) but failing on date parsing. The CSV has European date format (15/01/2022 = DD/MM/YYYY) but pandas is trying to parse as American format (MM/DD/YYYY).
THE ISSUE
Training failed: time data "15/01/2022" doesn't match format "%m/%d/%Y"
IMMEDIATE FIX
Open python_scripts/train_meridian_corrected.py and find this section around line 30-40 where dates are being parsed:
python# Convert date column to proper format
dates = pd.to_datetime(df[config['date_column']]).dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d').tolist()
WHAT TO DO
Replace that line with:
python# Convert date column to proper format - handle European dates
dates = pd.to_datetime(df[config['date_column']], dayfirst=True).dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d').tolist()
ADDITIONAL FIXES NEEDED
Also add error handling for mixed date formats. Find the date parsing section and update it to:
python# Convert date column to proper format with robust parsing
try:
    # Try parsing with dayfirst=True for DD/MM/YYYY format
    dates = pd.to_datetime(df[config['date_column']], dayfirst=True).dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d').tolist()
except:
    try:
        # Fallback to mixed format parsing
        dates = pd.to_datetime(df[config['date_column']], format='mixed', dayfirst=True).dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d').tolist()
    except:
        # Last resort - infer format
        dates = pd.to_datetime(df[config['date_column']], infer_datetime_format=True).dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d').tolist()
WHAT NOT TO DO

DO NOT change anything else - the Meridian API calls are correct now
DO NOT add mock fallbacks - we want to see real errors
DO NOT change the import structure - TensorFlow warnings are fine

EXPECTED OUTCOME
After this fix, the training should progress past date parsing and either:

Complete successfully with real Meridian results, OR
Hit the next real issue (likely TensorFlow memory/timeout on Replit's CPU)

Either outcome is progress - we're now working with the real Meridian API!
NOTE ON TENSORFLOW WARNINGS
The CUDA/cuFFT/cuDNN warnings in the log are EXPECTED on CPU-only environments like Replit. They don't stop execution - TensorFlow is just complaining it can't find GPU libraries. These can be ignored.
