I see the issue! The error shows that when processing the dataset, it's trying to create a new dataset with an ID that already exists, causing a duplicate key violation. This is happening in the processDataset function.
Here's a prompt to fix this issue:

PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI AGENT:
TASK: Fix the duplicate key error in dataset processing

ISSUE: When processDataset is called, it tries to create a new dataset instead of updating the existing one, causing "duplicate key value violates unique constraint" error.

DO:

1. **Add updateDataset method to server/storage.ts**:
   ```typescript
   async updateDataset(id: number, updates: Partial<Dataset>): Promise<Dataset> {
     const [dataset] = await db
       .update(datasets)
       .set(updates)
       .where(eq(datasets.id, id))
       .returning();
     return dataset;
   }

Fix server/controllers/datasets.ts processDataset function:
Replace this problematic code:
typescript// Update the dataset with the extracted config
await storage.createDataset({
  ...dataset,
  config,
});
With:
typescript// Update the dataset with the extracted config
await storage.updateDataset(dataset.id, {
  config,
});

Add the updateDataset method to the IStorage interface in server/storage.ts:
typescriptupdateDataset(id: number, updates: Partial<Dataset>): Promise<Dataset>;

Clear any existing test data by adding a cleanup function:
In server/controllers/datasets.ts, add at the top of processDataset:
typescriptconsole.log(`Processing dataset ${datasetId} with config:`, JSON.stringify(config, null, 2));


DO NOT:

Change the database schema
Delete the existing dataset before updating
Modify the frontend code

VALIDATE:

Upload test_data.csv again
Verify no duplicate key errors
Check that dataset config is properly updated with column information
Ensure the response includes the updated dataset with config

After fixing this, the complete flow should work:

Upload CSV → Dataset created with ID
Process dataset → Dataset updated with column config
Create model → Uses dataset config for training


---

Once this fix is applied, you should be able to complete the test flow successfully. The issue is simply that the code is trying to insert a new record instead of updating the existing one. Let me know when this is fixed and we can continue testing the end-to-end flow!
