I see the issue! The model is being created successfully (ID: 2) and training is completing, but the model details page can't find it. The problem is likely in the API endpoint routing or the model details page fetching logic.
Here's a prompt to fix this:

PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI AGENT:
TASK: Fix the "Model Not Found" error when navigating to /model/2 after creating a model

ISSUE: Model is created and trained successfully, but the model details page shows "Not Found"

DO diagnose and fix:

1. **Check the model details page routing**:
   In client/src/pages/model-details.tsx, verify it's fetching from the correct endpoint:
   ```typescript
   // Should be:
   const { data: model } = useQuery({
     queryKey: [`/api/models/${modelId}`],
   });
   
   // NOT:
   const { data: model } = useQuery({
     queryKey: [`/api/models`],
   });

Add the missing GET /api/models/:id endpoint:
In server/routes.ts, ensure this route exists:
typescriptapp.get("/api/models/:id", controllers.models.getModel);

Implement getModel in server/controllers/models.ts if missing:
typescriptexport const getModel = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const modelId = parseInt(req.params.id);
    if (isNaN(modelId)) {
      return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid model ID' });
    }

    const model = await storage.getModel(modelId);
    if (!model) {
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Model not found' });
    }

    return res.json(model);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error getting model:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to retrieve model' });
  }
};

Fix the model details page to handle loading and error states:
In client/src/pages/model-details.tsx:
typescriptif (isLoading) {
  return <div>Loading model...</div>;
}

if (error || !model) {
  return (
    <MainLayout title="Model Not Found">
      <div>The requested model could not be found</div>
    </MainLayout>
  );
}

Also add the GET /api/models/:id/results endpoint:
In server/routes.ts:
typescriptapp.get("/api/models/:id/results", controllers.models.getModelResults);


DO NOT:

Change the model creation logic
Modify the database schema
Break the training process

VALIDATE:

After fixing, create a new model and verify:

Model creation returns the model with ID
Navigation to /model/{id} shows the model details
Model results are displayed if training is complete
Check server logs for the correct API calls: GET /api/models/2



DEBUG TIPS:

Add console.log in model-details.tsx to see what modelId it's trying to fetch
Check browser network tab to see what API calls are being made
Verify the model exists in database: SELECT * FROM models WHERE id = 2;


---

This should fix the routing issue and allow you to view the model details after creation. The model is being created successfully, we just need to make sure the frontend can fetch it properly!
