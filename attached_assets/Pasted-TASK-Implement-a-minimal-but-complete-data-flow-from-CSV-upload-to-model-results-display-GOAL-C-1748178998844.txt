TASK: Implement a minimal but complete data flow from CSV upload to model results display

GOAL: Create ONE working path through the application: Upload CSV → Store in DB → Train Model → Show Results

DO implement in this exact order:

1. **Fix Dataset Upload (server/controllers/datasets.ts)**:
   - Make uploadDataset actually save files to disk
   - Store dataset metadata in the database
   - Return the saved dataset ID to frontend
   - Test: Upload a CSV and verify it's saved and recorded in DB

2. **Connect Frontend Upload to Backend (client/src/pages/upload-dataset.tsx)**:
   - Make FileUpload component actually POST to /api/datasets
   - Show success/error messages based on response
   - Navigate to datasets list after successful upload
   - Test: Upload CSV and see it in the datasets page

3. **Implement Basic Model Training (server/controllers/models.ts)**:
   - Make createModel endpoint work with minimal config
   - Actually call python_scripts/train_meridian.py using python-runner
   - For now, have train_meridian.py create MOCK results (don't integrate real Meridian yet)
   - Store mock results in database
   - Test: Create a model and verify it completes with mock results

4. **Display Model Results (client/src/components/dashboard/model-summary.tsx)**:
   - Fetch actual model results from /api/models/{id}/results
   - Display the mock data in the existing visualization components
   - Test: View a completed model and see charts with data

5. **Add Basic Error Handling**:
   - Catch and display errors at each step
   - Add loading states during file upload and model training
   - Show clear error messages if something fails

DO NOT:
- Add new features or UI components
- Implement authentication yet
- Try to integrate real Meridian training yet
- Add complex validations or optimizations
- Change the database schema

IMPLEMENTATION HINTS:
- Start with mock data in train_meridian.py that returns a simple JSON structure
- Use console.log liberally to debug the data flow
- Test each step before moving to the next
- Keep the model config simple (just project_id and dataset_id for now)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
□ Can upload a CSV file
□ File appears in datasets list
□ Can create a model from that dataset
□ Model training completes (with mock results)
□ Can view model results with populated charts
□ Errors are caught and displayed to user

Once this works end-to-end, we can replace mock results with real Meridian training.
