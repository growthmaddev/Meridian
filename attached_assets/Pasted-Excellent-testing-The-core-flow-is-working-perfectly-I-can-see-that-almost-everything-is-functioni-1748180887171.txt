Excellent testing! The core flow is working perfectly. I can see that almost everything is functioning except for the Response Curves and Adstock Effects visualizations. Let's fix these missing visualizations:

PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI AGENT:
TASK: Fix the Response Curves and Adstock Effects visualizations that show "No data available"

ISSUE: Model results contain data but response_curves section is not properly formatted for the visualization components

DO:

1. **Check what data structure the visualization expects**:
   Look at client/src/components/dashboard/response-curves.tsx to understand the expected format for responseCurves prop

2. **Update python_scripts/simple_mock_train.py to generate proper response curves data**:
   In the generate_mock_results function, ensure response_curves matches this structure:
   ```python
   "response_curves": {
       "tv_spend": {
           "saturation": {
               "ec": 3.5,  # Half saturation point
               "slope": 2.8
           },
           "adstock": {
               "decay": 0.7,  # Decay rate
               "peak": 2  # Peak week
           }
       },
       "radio_spend": {
           "saturation": {
               "ec": 2.1,
               "slope": 2.3
           },
           "adstock": {
               "decay": 0.5,
               "peak": 1
           }
       },
       "digital_spend": {
           "saturation": {
               "ec": 4.2,
               "slope": 3.1
           },
           "adstock": {
               "decay": 0.3,
               "peak": 0
           }
       },
       "print_spend": {
           "saturation": {
               "ec": 2.8,
               "slope": 2.5
           },
           "adstock": {
               "decay": 0.6,
               "peak": 3
           }
       }
   }

Verify the data is correctly passed to components:
In client/src/pages/model-details.tsx, check that modelResults?.results_json?.response_curves is being passed to ResponseCurvesSection component
Add debug logging if needed:
typescriptconsole.log('Response curves data:', modelResults?.results_json?.response_curves);


DO NOT:

Change the visualization logic in ResponseCurvesSection
Modify working parts like channel contributions
Break the existing mock data generation

VALIDATE:

After fixing, create a new model and verify:

Response curves show Hill saturation curves for each channel
Adstock effects show decay curves over weeks
Both charts have working channel selectors
No console errors about missing data



EXPECTED RESULT:
Both Response Curves and Adstock Effects tabs should display interactive charts showing:

Response Curves: How response changes with spend (diminishing returns)
Adstock Effects: How marketing impact decays over time


---

Once this is fixed, you'll have a complete working Marketing Mix Modeling application with all visualizations functioning! The response curves are crucial for understanding diminishing returns in marketing spend.
