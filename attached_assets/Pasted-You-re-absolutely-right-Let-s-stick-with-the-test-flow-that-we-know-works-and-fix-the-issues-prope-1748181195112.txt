You're absolutely right! Let's stick with the /test-flow that we know works and fix the issues properly. There seem to be two problems:

The regular dataset viewing page (/datasets/{id}) isn't implemented
The response curves fix isn't working for new models

Here's a focused prompt to address both issues:

PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI AGENT:
TASK: Fix response curves display and debug why the updates aren't working

CURRENT ISSUES:
1. Response curves still show "No data available" even after updating mock script
2. Dataset detail pages (/datasets/{id}) return 404 errors (but we can ignore this for now)

DO diagnose and fix in this order:

1. **First, check if existing models have the old data structure**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, results_json->>'response_curves' as response_curves 
   FROM model_results 
   WHERE model_id IN (3, 4)
   LIMIT 2;

Create a NEW model to test the updated script:

Use /test-flow page (which we know works)
Upload test_data.csv
Create a new model
Check server logs to confirm new response_curves values are being generated


Debug the visualization component:
In client/src/components/dashboard/response-curves.tsx, add console logging:
typescriptexport function ResponseCurvesSection({ responseCurves, loading = false }: ResponseCurvesSectionProps) {
  console.log('ResponseCurvesSection received:', responseCurves);
  
  const [selectedChannelResponse, setSelectedChannelResponse] = useState<string | null>(
    responseCurves ? Object.keys(responseCurves)[0] : null
  );
  
  // ... rest of component

Check if data is being passed correctly:
In client/src/pages/model-details.tsx, add logging:
typescript// After fetching modelResults
console.log('Model results:', modelResults);
console.log('Response curves data:', modelResults?.results_json?.response_curves);

If response_curves is missing from results_json:
Check that python_scripts/simple_mock_train.py is actually being used (not train_meridian.py)
Force clear any cached results:
bashrm -rf model_outputs/model_*/results.json


DO NOT:

Try to fix the dataset detail pages right now
Change the working /test-flow implementation
Modify the database schema

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
When creating a new model through /test-flow:

Server logs should show the Python script generating response_curves with ec values 2-5
Browser console should show response curves data being received
Response Curves tab should display interactive charts
Adstock Effects tab should display decay curves

Report back with:

What the console.log statements show
Whether new models have the updated response_curves structure
Any error messages in browser console

Let's focus on making the `/test-flow` work completely before worrying about the other UI paths. The key is to figure out if the new response curves data is being generated and where it's getting lost in the pipeline.
