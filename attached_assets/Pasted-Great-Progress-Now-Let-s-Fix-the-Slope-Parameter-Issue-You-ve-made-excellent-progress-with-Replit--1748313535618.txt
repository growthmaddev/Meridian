Great Progress! Now Let's Fix the Slope Parameter Issue
You've made excellent progress with Replit:

✅ Multi-channel visualization working
✅ Data tables added
✅ Real EC values displaying correctly
⚠️ All slope values = 1.0 (suspicious!)

The Slope Problem
Looking at your extraction:
tv_spend: EC = 1.204, slope = 1
radio_spend: EC = 1.059, slope = 1  
digital_spend: EC = 1.373, slope = 1
print_spend: EC = 1.382, slope = 1
This is almost certainly incorrect. Different channels should have different slopes representing how quickly they saturate.
Prompt for Replit to Investigate Slope Extraction:

Investigate Why All Slope Parameters = 1.0
We're seeing all channels with slope=1, which is highly unlikely. Please investigate the slope parameter extraction in train_meridian_corrected.py.
Current extraction code:
pythonslope_values = posterior.get('slope_m')
if slope_values is not None:
    slope_mean = np.mean(slope_values, axis=(0, 1))
Tasks:

Add detailed logging to understand what's in posterior['slope_m']:

python# After getting slope_values
print(json.dumps({
    "debug": "slope_m_raw",
    "shape": str(slope_values.shape) if slope_values is not None else "None",
    "unique_values": str(np.unique(slope_values)) if slope_values is not None else "None",
    "first_samples": slope_values[0, 0, :].tolist() if slope_values is not None else []
}))

Check if Meridian is using fixed slopes:

Look for model configuration that might set hill_slope_fixed=True
Check if the model specification constrains slopes to 1


Verify the posterior variable name:

Could it be alpha_m or another variable for slopes?
List all posterior keys and their shapes to find slope-like parameters


If slopes are genuinely fixed at 1:

Add a note in the UI: "Note: This model uses fixed slope=1 for all channels"
Consider if the model needs reconfiguration to allow variable slopes


Alternative slope parameters to check:

alpha_m - sometimes used for Hill transformation power
beta_m - might contain transformation parameters
Any parameter with shape matching number of channels



Expected outcome: Either find the real varying slope values or confirm that the model is configured with fixed slopes=1.

This will help determine if:

We're extracting from the wrong posterior variable
The model is genuinely using fixed slopes (configuration issue)
There's a bug in the extraction logic

Once we know which scenario it is, we can fix it appropriately!
