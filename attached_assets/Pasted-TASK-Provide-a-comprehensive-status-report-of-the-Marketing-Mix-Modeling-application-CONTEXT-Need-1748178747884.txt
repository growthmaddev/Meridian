TASK: Provide a comprehensive status report of the Marketing Mix Modeling application

CONTEXT: Need to verify what's currently implemented and working versus what's documented as planned in attached_assets/comprehensive_project_documentation.md

PLEASE ANALYZE AND REPORT:

1. **Currently Working Features** (test each and confirm):
   - User authentication and login system
   - Project creation and management
   - CSV dataset upload functionality
   - Data processing and column detection
   - Model configuration interface
   - Model training with Meridian integration
   - Model results visualization (ROI, contributions)
   - Response curves (saturation/adstock)
   - Budget optimization scenarios
   - Database operations (CRUD for all entities)

2. **Partially Implemented Features** (started but not complete):
   - List any features that exist in code but don't fully work
   - Identify missing connections between frontend and backend
   - Note any UI elements that exist but lack functionality

3. **Documented but Not Implemented** (from comprehensive_project_documentation.md):
   - Multi-tenant architecture (agencies/clients hierarchy)
   - Role-based access control
   - Google Query Volume (GQV) integration
   - Reach/frequency data support
   - Background job processing with progress updates
   - Email notifications
   - Export functionality (PDF/PowerPoint)
   - Billing/subscription management
   - Advanced priors configuration
   - Model comparison features

4. **Code Quality Check**:
   - Are the Python scripts (train_meridian.py, optimize_budget.py) actually being called?
   - Is the model training producing real results or mock data?
   - Are there any hardcoded values that should be dynamic?
   - Any TODO comments indicating incomplete features?

5. **Critical Issues or Bugs**:
   - Any errors in the console during normal operation?
   - Database connection issues?
   - File upload size limits or timeouts?
   - Model training failures?
