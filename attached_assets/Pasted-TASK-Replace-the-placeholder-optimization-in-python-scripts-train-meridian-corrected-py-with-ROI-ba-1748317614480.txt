TASK: Replace the placeholder optimization in python_scripts/train_meridian_corrected.py with ROI-based allocation
FIND this section in the extract_real_meridian_results function:
python# Calculate total spend
total_spend = 500000.0  # Default estimate
try:
    hist_spend = analyzer.get_historical_spend()
    if hasattr(hist_spend, 'numpy'):
        hist_spend = hist_spend.numpy()
    total_spend = float(np.sum(hist_spend))
except:
    pass

optimization = {
    "current_budget": total_spend,
    "optimal_allocation": {ch: total_spend / len(channels) for ch in channels},
    "expected_lift": 0.0
}
