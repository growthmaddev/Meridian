# Marketing Mix Modeling Application Status Report

## ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING:

**Database Schema**: Complete schema defined with tables for users, projects, datasets, models, model results, and optimization scenarios.

**Project Structure**: Full-stack architecture with React/TypeScript frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database.

**UI Components**: Basic UI components and layouts using Shadcn/UI and TailwindCSS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING:

**Project Creation**: Interface exists | Not connected to backend API endpoints.

**Dataset Upload**: Upload component exists | Not processing files or saving to database.

**Menu Navigation**: Sidebar and navigation components | Many links lead to empty or incomplete pages.

**Model Configuration**: Form components created | Not integrated with actual model training workflow.

**Data Visualization**: Component templates exist | Not populated with real data from models.

## ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED:

**User Authentication**: Documented in schema but login system not implemented.

**Model Training**: Python scripts exist but not integrated with the application flow.

**Budget Optimization**: UI components exist but not connected to optimization logic.

**Multi-tenant Architecture**: Mentioned in documentation but not implemented.

**Role-based Access Control**: Documented but not implemented.

**Google Query Volume Integration**: Mentioned in documentation but no implementation.

**Reach/Frequency Data Support**: Documented but not implemented.

**Background Job Processing**: No queue system or progress updates implemented.

**Email Notifications**: Not implemented.

**Export Functionality**: No PDF/PowerPoint export capabilities.

**Billing/Subscription Management**: Not implemented.

**Advanced Priors Configuration**: Not implemented.

**Model Comparison Features**: Not implemented.

## üêõ BUGS/ISSUES:

**SelectItem Component**: Fixed issues with empty value props, but may have other instances.

**Database Connection**: PostgreSQL setup present but not fully tested in production context.

**Frontend-Backend Integration**: Many API endpoints defined but not fully implemented.

**Python Integration**: Scripts for Meridian exist but execution pathway not tested.

## üìù RECOMMENDATIONS:

**Priority 1**: Implement core data flow - connect project creation, dataset upload, and basic model configuration to create an end-to-end workflow for at least one feature.

**Priority 2**: Integrate Python scripts for model training with proper error handling and progress feedback.

**Priority 3**: Implement basic user authentication to support multi-user functionality.

**Priority 4**: Develop the visualization components for model results with real data.

**Priority 5**: Add budget optimization functionality once model training is working.

## NEXT STEPS:

1. Focus on making one complete end-to-end flow work before expanding features
2. Implement proper error handling and user feedback throughout the application
3. Consider implementing a background job system for long-running model training tasks
4. Add comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
5. Create automated tests for critical components
